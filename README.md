### Project Background
Bali stands as an enchanting holiday destination attracting visitors from diverse corners of the world. Nestled in the heart of Southeast Asia, Bali's unique blend of rich cultural heritage, lush landscapes, and pristine beaches has made it a magnet for tourists seeking an immersive and exotic experience. However, with the island's popularity comes the responsibility to understand and mitigate potential risks, particularly in the face of extreme weather events, such as extreme precipitation. Extreme precipitation events, characterized by intense and prolonged rainfall, can lead to flash floods, landslides, and other natural disasters. The frequency and intensity of such events are influenced by various climatic factors. One crucial parameter for assessing extreme precipitation is the return period, which provides insights into the likelihood of a specific event occurring within a given timeframe.

The return period is like predicting how often such heavy rain and flooding might happen. If someone says there is a "10-year return period" for heavy rain at your park, it doesn't mean it will only rain heavily once every 10 years. Instead, it suggests that, on average, you might expect that level of heavy rain and flooding about once every 10 years. 

The return period is closely linked to the threshold or level of precipitation that is associated with a particular event, such as flooding. It helps us understand how often we can expect a certain amount of precipitation to occur, and by extension, the likelihood of flooding or other related events.

For example, if a specific level of precipitation is associated with a 10-year return period, it means that, on average, we can expect that level of precipitation to occur approximately once every 10 years. This information is crucial for assessing flood potential and planning appropriate measures to mitigate the impacts of such events.


### Objectives
1. Identification of vulnerable areas prone to extreme precipitation events
2. Improved understanding of the return periods associated with different levels of precipitation intensity
3. Recommendations for infrastructure improvements and disaster preparedness measures
